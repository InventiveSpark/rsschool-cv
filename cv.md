### Summary

I worked at UGATU University as a teacher and engaged in research activities on AON (All-Optical Networks). I conducted classes and laboratory work, led coursework and diploma design, and organized scientific and educational events. I worked on creating an experimental laboratory of optoelectronic devices, carried out the selection and purchase of equipment, and compiled technical specifications to create unique experimental optoelectronic installations. I have 15 scientific publications: I am the author and co-author of several [textbooks for students of technical universities](https://rusneb.ru/catalog/000219_000026_RU_%D0%93%D0%9F%D0%9D%D0%A2%D0%91+%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_IBIS_0000410655/) (including the [MAI](https://en.mai.ru/), Moscow), as well as several scientific articles published in English-speaking publications (Washington, USA). I edited, proofread, and layout out textbooks on technical and humanitarian topics created graphic and photo illustrations, and prepared original mock-ups. 

I have a few years of academic experience in applied programming for creating several desktop applications for a laboratory workshop in the following disciplines: "Electromagnetic Fields and Waves," "Microprocessors in Telecommunication Systems." One of my apps was awarded a diploma from the All-Russian Competition of works in the "Radio Engineering, Electronics, and Communications" section at [MTUCI](https://mtuci.ru/?lang=en).
Later, I was the head of software development for creating desktop applications for a laboratory workshop on the discipline "Transmission Lines in Telecommunication."

I have been interested in programming since my school days. While still a student, I created a web page for the Department of Telecommunication Systems published on the UGATU Web server. In my graduation project, I wrote a full-fledged application of scientific calculation and visualization. Then, as a university teacher, as mentioned above, I developed software for a laboratory workshop and managed the development.
Now I am actively mastering the profession of a programmer and see my future career in this area. Since September 2020, I have been actively studying computer science and web development, taking online courses, and have completed projects. In 2022 I completed a professional retraining course in web development. I desire to learn, am willing to accept feedback, and try new things.
